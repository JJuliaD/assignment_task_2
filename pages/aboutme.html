        I have made a visual representation of my work and what I am capable of,
        as well as my personality and who I am as a person. <br />
        <br />I consider myself a creative and artistic student who has a
        passion for producing artwork and photography. As an aspiring graphic
        designer my goal is to become an experienced designer, designing product
        posters as well as product photography. I have included the following
        portfolio as part of my resume to demonstrate my capability and aptitude
        in hand drawing designs, photography/modelling, as well as UX design and
        aesthetic.
